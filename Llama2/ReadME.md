## Componenets introduced in Llama models


- **[Improvements_in_llama.ipynb](Improvements_in_llama.ipynb)** is the notebook containing some of the new modules added in the llama models compared to the vanilla transformer.

- **[tinyllama2_manual.ipynb](tinyllama2_manual.ipynb)** is the notebook containing functions which allow to verify each and every induvidual layer's intermediate output from the huggingface's llama implementation.



- **[tinyllama2_gqa.ipynb](tinyllama2_gqa.ipynb)** is the notebook where the tinyllama model is called for inference, only 1 decoder layer and modified configurations

- **pytorch_src** :- This directory contains all the modified source code from the pytorch library (print staements were added instead of registering the intermediate outputs)
